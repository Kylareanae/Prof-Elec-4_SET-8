Project Overview
	The PLM RFID Library is a library management system designed to enhance library operations through the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. It is typically implemented as a web application. The aim is to develop a system that allows users to manage and return books seamlessly using RFID. The system tracks borrowed and returned books, sends overdue notifications, and integrates with RFID readers.
