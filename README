Project Overview
	The PLM RFID Library is a library management system designed to enhance library operations through the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. It is typically implemented as a web application. The aim is to develop a system that allows users to manage and return books seamlessly using RFID. The system tracks borrowed and returned books, sends overdue notifications, and integrates with RFID readers. 

Setup Instructions (User Side)
The PLM RFID Library has a user side. Below are the setup instructions for it:

Login and Signup Page
A welcome page appears, providing the user with the option to either login or register. Once the user selects their desired option, the next step is to choose between scanning an RFID card or logging in manually. If a user opts for RFID, they need to prepare their RFID card and scan it using the scanner. 
If the user already has an account, they can login using their email address and password. If the user doesn't have an account yet, they can click the "Register an Account" button to create one.
To register, the user needs to enter their credentials and once done, they can click the "Register Now" button. After completing this step, they can click the "Link RFID Card" button below and proceed to scan their RFID card. Additionally, if a user has any inquiries or concerns, they can email ul@plm.edu.ph.

Home Page
After the user has completed registering their account, the system's homepage will appear, displaying buttons such as Return, Borrow, Search, Profile, and Logout.

Borrow Page
If the user wants to borrow a book, they need to click the "Borrow" button and they need to scan the book using the scanner. Once scanned, the book details, including the title, author, publisher, and status of the book, will be displayed. Below the details, buttons such as "Borrow Book" and "Scan Again" will appear if the user wants to repeat the process.

	Return Page
If the user wants to return a book, they need to click the "Return" button. If a user wants to return a book, they need to click the "Return" button. A page will appear displaying details such as the book cover, title, author, date borrowed, deadline of the book, and an action option (e.g., "Return"). 
If the user's borrowed book is overdue by 2 days, a notification will appear below, stating that their borrowed book is overdue by 2 days and prompting them to return the book now.
After the user returns their overdue borrowed book, they need to scan the book again. A message will appear confirming that the book has been returned successfully.
