**Description:** 
The PLM RFID Library is a web-based library management system that utilizes Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to streamline library operations and improve the user experience.
By automating key processes such as book tracking, borrowing, and returns, the system enhances operational efficiency and accuracy. It allows users to check out and return books seamlessly, with
real-time tracking of borrowed items and automated overdue notifications. The integration with RFID readers enables quick, error-free identification and management of books, reducing manual tasks
for staff and improving service for users. Ultimately, the system aims to modernize library operations, making them faster, more efficient, and user-friendly.

**Key Features:**
**Feature 1: RFID Integration for Book Borrowed and Returns**
  - It allows users to borrow and return books using RFID technology. Each book is tagged with an RFID label, and the system automatically registers checkouts and returns through an RFID reader.
**Feature 2: User Registration and Library Card Management**
  - Users can register for an account, which includes issuing a library card. This card is linked to the user's profile and can be used for faster checkouts with RFID.
**Feature 3: Book Availability Tracking and Overdue Notifications**
  - The system monitors the availability of each book in real-time and sends automated reminders to users if a borrowed book is overdue.

**Technologies Used:**
-------------------- 

**Intended Audience:**
The PLM RFID Library system will be used by a variety of individuals, including students, library staff, and general users. Students will primarily use the system to borrow, return, and
manage their books and resources, benefiting from faster checkouts and automated overdue notifications. Library administrators will utilize the system to oversee inventory management, track
book circulation, generate reports, and manage user accounts. General users, which may include faculty, staff, or community members, will also interact with the system to access library materials,
with the same ease of use and efficiency. By catering to these different groups, the system aims to streamline library operations and enhance the overall experience for all users.

**Getting Started:**
**Installation Instructions:**
To set up the PLM RFID Library System, start by connecting the RFID Reader to your computer, either via a USB connection or through a network setup, depending on the type of reader you're using. 
Ensure that the reader is properly installed and recognized by your system. Once the RFID Reader is set up, proceed to attach the RFID tags to the library books. These tags contain unique 
identification numbers, which will help track each item in the library system. 

**System Requirements:**
**Software Requirements:** (not sure)
The system requires the .NET SDK to be installed for running and building the project. For the development environment, Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with the C# Dev Kit and C# extensions is necessary. Additionally, a compatible database system, such as SQL Server or MySQL, is required if the project involves database integration.

**Hardware Requirements:** (not sure)
The system requires a minimum of 4 GB of RAM, a 2 GHz CPU, and at least 500 MB of free disk space to ensure optimal performance and functionality.

**Additional Hardware:**
For full system integration with RFID devices, an RFID reader is required to enable seamless interaction and functionality.

**How To Run The Project:**
1. If you are using Visual Studio Code, ensure that you have the C# Dev Kit, C#, and .NET installed on your computer. You can download .NET from this link: (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
2. Extract the provided ZIP file and open the extracted folder named Cañada_Rimuel_Set2.
3. Launch Visual Studio Code and press Ctrl + K, then O to open a folder.
4. Select the Cañada_Rimuel_Set2 folder.
5. Press Ctrl + Shift + '' to open the terminal, then type dotnet run` and press Enter.
6. The Simple Search Function will start. Feel free to explore the system.


**Using the Sytem**
1. **Front Page**
The website provides two options on the homepage: users with an existing account can log in, while new users can register to create an account for the PLM Library website.

2. **Registering an Account**
When registering an account, the user is asked to input all the necessary details such as full name, student number, course, email address and password. The user may also link their RFID Card to automatically fill up the details based on the information filled in RFID Card. After all the information has been filled up and double checked by the user, they must link their RFID Card for easier access to the library system, after linking the user may now click “Register Now” button to successfully register their account.
