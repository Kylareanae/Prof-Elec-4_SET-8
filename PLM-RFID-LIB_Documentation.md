**Description:** 
- The PLM RFID Library is a web-based library management system that utilizes Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to streamline library operations and improve the user experience. By automating key processes such as book tracking, borrowing, and returns, the system enhances operational efficiency and accuracy. It allows users to check out and return books seamlessly, with real-time tracking of borrowed items and automated overdue notifications. The integration with RFID readers enables quick, error-free identification and management of books, reducing manual tasks for staff and improving service for users. Ultimately, the system aims to modernize library operations, making them faster, more efficient, and user-friendly.

**Key Features:**
**1) RFID Integration for Book Borrowed and Returns** - It allows users to borrow and return books using RFID technology. Each book is tagged with an RFID label, and the system automatically registers checkouts and returns through an RFID reader.
**2) User Registration and Library Card Management** - Users can register for an account, which includes issuing a library card. This card is linked to the user's profile and can be used for faster checkouts with RFID.
**3) Book Availability Tracking and Overdue Notifications** - The system monitors the availability of each book in real-time and sends automated reminders to users if a borrowed book is overdue.












**Setup Instructions (USER SIDE)**

they can click the "Register an Account" button to create one.To register, the user needs to enter their credentials and once done, they can click the "Register Now" button. After completing this step, they can click the "Link RFID Card" button below 
and proceed to scan their RFID card. Additionally, if a user has any inquiries or concerns, they can email ul@plm.edu.ph.

- If the user wants to borrow a book, they need to click the "Borrow" button and they need to scan the book using the scanner. Once scanned, the book details, including the title, author, publisher, and status of the book, will be displayed. 
Below the details, buttons such as "Borrow Book" and "Scan Again" will appear if the user wants to repeat the process.
